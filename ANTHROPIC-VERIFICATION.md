# üîç Anthropic Integration Verification

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: ‚è≥ **WAITING FOR RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT QUEUE**

---

## üö® Railway Platform Issue (CURRENT)

**Railway Message**:
```
Limited Access
Dockerhub was down, deploy queue is full
```

**What This Means**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Docker Hub (Docker's image registry) experienced downtime
- ‚è≥ Railway's deployment queue is backed up
- ‚úÖ Your environment variable changes are saved and queued
- ‚è≥ Deployment will proceed automatically once queue clears

**Estimated Wait Time**: 10 minutes to a few hours (depends on Railway's queue)

**What You've Already Done** ‚úÖ:
1. ‚úÖ Updated ZodForge API key in Railway ‚Üí Queued for deployment
2. ‚úÖ Added Anthropic API key to Railway ‚Üí Queued for deployment

**No Action Required**: Just wait for Railway to process the deployment queue.

---

## Current Production Status

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "uptime": 166,
  "services": {
    "openai": "up",
    "anthropic": "down"  ‚Üê Will change to "up" after redeploy
  }
}
```

**Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ Version 0.2.0 is deployed (Phase 2 code is live)
- ‚úÖ OpenAI is working correctly
- ‚è≥ Anthropic queued to activate (waiting for Railway redeploy)

---

## Possible Causes (For Reference)

### 1. Railway Hasn't Redeployed Yet (Most Likely)
**Symptom**: Uptime of 166 seconds suggests server hasn't restarted since adding the key.

**What Happens**:
- When you add/update environment variables in Railway, it typically triggers an automatic redeploy
- However, sometimes Railway requires manual trigger or may be queued

**How to Check**:
1. Go to Railway dashboard: https://railway.com/project/b4b6b858-eef1-4318-b425-5ead7f443a74
2. Look for "Deployments" section
3. Check if a new deployment was triggered after you added `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
4. If not, you may need to manually trigger a redeploy

**How to Fix**:
- Click "Deploy" ‚Üí "Redeploy" in Railway dashboard
- Or: Make a small code change and push to GitHub (triggers auto-deploy)

---

### 2. Anthropic API Key Not Added Correctly

**How to Verify in Railway**:
1. Go to: https://railway.com/project/b4b6b858-eef1-4318-b425-5ead7f443a74
2. Click "Variables" tab
3. Verify you see: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = sk-ant-...`

**Common Mistakes**:
- ‚ùå Variable name typo (should be exactly `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
- ‚ùå Added to wrong service/environment
- ‚ùå Key has extra spaces or newlines

**Correct Format**:
```
Variable Name: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
Value: sk-ant-api03-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

---

### 3. Anthropic API Key Invalid

**How to Test**:
- Go to: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
- Verify the key is shown as "Active"
- Check if billing is enabled (Anthropic requires payment method)

**If Key is Invalid**:
1. Delete the old key in Anthropic Console
2. Create a new key
3. Update Railway with the new key
4. Trigger redeploy

---

## Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Check Railway Variables
```
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click "Variables" tab
3. Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY exists
4. Verify it starts with "sk-ant-"
```

### Step 2: Check Railway Deployment
```
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Look for recent deployment after adding key
4. If no deployment: Click "Deploy" ‚Üí "Redeploy"
```

### Step 3: Wait for Redeploy (2-3 minutes)
Railway will:
- Install dependencies (including @anthropic-ai/sdk)
- Compile TypeScript
- Start server with new environment variable
- Health check should then show `"anthropic": "up"`

### Step 4: Verify Health Endpoint
```bash
curl https://web-production-f15d.up.railway.app/api/v1/health
```

**Expected Result (after successful redeploy)**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "uptime": 15,  ‚Üê Low uptime (recently restarted)
  "services": {
    "openai": "up",
    "anthropic": "up"  ‚Üê Should change to "up"
  }
}
```

## Expected Startup Logs (After Redeploy)

When Railway redeploys with the Anthropic key, you should see logs like:

```
‚úÖ Environment variables validated successfully
üîê OpenAI API Key: sk-proj********************qwkA
üîë ZodForge API Key: zf_e41b********************b9e9
ü§ñ Anthropic API Key: sk-ant-********************abcd
   ‚Üí Claude fallback enabled ‚úÖ
üìä Rate Limit: 100 req/900000ms

üè≠ Provider factory initialized
   Primary: openai
   Fallback: enabled
   Providers available: openai, anthropic

üöÄ Server listening at http://0.0.0.0:3000
üìç Health check: GET /api/v1/health
üìç Schema refinement: POST /api/v1/refine
```

Look for: `‚Üí Claude fallback enabled ‚úÖ` and `Providers available: openai, anthropic`

---

## Quick Diagnostic Commands

### Test Health Endpoint
```bash
curl https://web-production-f15d.up.railway.app/api/v1/health
```

### Test Schema Refinement (with new ZodForge API key)
```bash
curl -X POST https://web-production-f15d.up.railway.app/api/v1/refine \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer zf_e41b391f6e61b8bba12bd488a719410ba4d56a99de34ac320bcab6c518fab9e9" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "schema": {
      "code": "z.object({ email: z.string() })",
      "typeName": "User",
      "fields": { "email": "z.string()" }
    },
    "samples": [{ "email": "test@example.com" }]
  }'
```

**Expected**: Should return refined schema (uses OpenAI by default, falls back to Claude if needed)

---

## Summary

**What You've Done**:
- ‚úÖ Updated ZodForge API key in Railway
- ‚úÖ Added Anthropic API key to Railway

**What Needs to Happen**:
- ‚è≥ Railway needs to redeploy with the new environment variables
- ‚è≥ Server needs to restart to pick up Anthropic key
- ‚è≥ Health check should then show both providers as "up"

**Next Steps**:
1. Check Railway dashboard for recent deployments
2. Manually trigger redeploy if needed
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
4. Test health endpoint again
5. Verify `"anthropic": "up"`
